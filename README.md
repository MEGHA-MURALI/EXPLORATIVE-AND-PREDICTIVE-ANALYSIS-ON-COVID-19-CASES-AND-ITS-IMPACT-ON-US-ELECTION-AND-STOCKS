Coronavirus is a large family of viruses, and it is declared as a global pandemic by WHO. Millions 
of people have been infected and lost their lives due to COVID-19. In our work, we are accurately 
showing the analytical and forecasting studies. We are presenting the coronavirus cases worldwide 
from January 22, 2020, to November 27, 2020, with the top 10 affected countries. These countries 
are the US, India, Brazil, Russia, Spain, France, Peru, United Kingdom, Colombia, and Mexico. 
A detailed study was carried out on coronavirus to observe the confirmed and death cases in the 
US. The model building is done using the Time Series Algorithm Autoregressive Integrated 
Moving Average (ARIMA). This analysis will help to understand the severity of COVID-19 in the 
US in detail. The model building evaluation is based on Mean absolute percentage error (MAPE). 
We are also extending our work to analyze the impact of pandemic affected on various stock 
sectors and economy in the US. This study helps us to understand the difference in the stock market 
between 2019 and 2020.
In total the study is done based on 8 datasets provided
